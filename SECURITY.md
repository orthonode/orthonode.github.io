# Security Policy

## 🛰️ Orthonode Security Philosophy
As an infrastructure laboratory focused on physical verification, security is our foundational constraint. We take all reports seriously and prioritize the integrity of the Orthonode Assurance Platform (OAP) and the Nexus Protocol.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We currently operate a **coordinated disclosure** policy. If you discover a security vulnerability within this repository or the `orthonode.xyz` console, please do not open a public GitHub Issue.

Instead, please report it via:
* **Email:** infrastructure@orthonode.xyz
* **Subject:** [VULNERABILITY REPORT] <Short Description>

**Please include:**
1. A detailed description of the vulnerability.
2. Steps to reproduce (Proof of Concept).
3. Potential impact on kinematic auditing or data sovereignty.

## Response Timeline
We aim to acknowledge all reports within **48 hours** and provide a preliminary assessment or remediation plan within **7 business days**.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
* `orthonode.xyz`
* The Orthonode Master Repository
* Nexus Protocol (v1.4.0) Research Documentation

*Thank you for helping us maintain the integrity of physical reality.*
